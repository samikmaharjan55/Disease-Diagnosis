Items 1) - 3)
- Dataset in CSV format
- Source "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease"

Items 4) - 8)
- Basic Fuzzy Logic Mamdani Model for each of the 5 inputs used for heart diesease
- Files are built to compare different sets of fuzzy membership functions for each input to determine the best for each
- Imports Membership.py
- Implements fuzzy logic mamdani model
- Built with simple rules with different sets of membership functions
- Simple models were tested and visualized using datasets 1) - 3) Simple models were tested and visualized using datasets 1) - 3)

Items 9)
- Upon determining the best membership functions and simple rules for each input, the selected membership function for each input and used in the final model
- Composite rules were built for the overall mamdani model. 
- The final model was tested and visualized using datasets 1) - 3) to determine accuracy and confusion matrix

Items 10)
- Generic function with multiple templates of membership functions to be called by each individual python files of 4) - 9)

Items 11) 
- Report detailing the entire Program and Fuzzy Logic System
